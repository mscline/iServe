iServe Restaurant Edition

Greg Tropino (CoreData) & Mychilo Cline (UI)

Waiters use iPads to take customer orders, send tickets to kitchen, tally bills, and track sales and basic inventory.

ORDERING:

To order 2 cokes and a pizza, select the "table icon" in the middle-left of the screen.  (When you open the program for the first time, there will only be one table.)  On the table, you will see three icons, a "+ Drink" icon, a "+ Pizza" icon, and a drawing of a pizza.  These black and white icons of the drink and the pizza let us know where we can drag and drop food items.  You can find food items in the "Menu Items" bar on the right side of the screen.  Select on pizza to see different options and drag and drop a Cheese Pizza item from Menu Items onto the + Pizza icon.  Now drag a sprite and coke onto the screen.  Select the Menu Items or back buttons to get back to see the various menu options.    If you make a mistake and decide that you don't want a sprite, select on the unwanted object on the screen to select it and then hit the delete button in the "Clipboard" menu on the bottom left of the screen.  When you hit add or delete, it will temporarily store a copy of the item on the clipboard on the bottom of the screen.  You can drag and drop items on the clipboard back onto the screen.  

When you are ready to send the order to the kitchen, hit the "Place Order" button in the "Order Menu" (top left of the screen).  Every time the Place Order button is pressed, it will send any current new food items to the kitchen.  When you are ready to print the bill, press the "Close Order" button.  To view "tickets" / orders that have been sent to the kitchen (and have not been closed), or to view closed orders, use the "View Active Tickets" and "View Closed Tickets" buttons in the header at the top of the screen.  You will also see a "Clear Table" button for your convenience.  It will clear all the food off a table (the one you are in), but will not affect placed orders.

NAVIGATION:

To view a table, select it.  To get back to the main restaurant menu, select "Restaurant View" (top of the screen, left side).  If you are not sure what screen you are in, look at the text label to the right of the View Restaurant Button, which will tell you what table you are on.

SETTING UP TABLES:

Currently, there is only one table in our restaurant, and it will be necessary to create additional tables.  In order to create tables, move them, or name them, it is necessary to go into Edit Mode.  Select the edit mode button at the top of the screen (right side).  Edit mode has the same basic layout you are already familiar with.  You will see items you can drag and drop in a menu on the right, a clip board on the bottom, and familiar buttons on the top.  The Orders menu (where you can submit an order to the kitchen) has been replaced by the Build menu.  

In order to rename a table, select on it to select it, and hit the rename button.  To copy your table, and everything inside, select on the table and hit the "+ Copy" button.  The table will be copied to your clipboard and you can drag and drop it to your desired location.  If you would like to create a new table with nothing inside of it, drag and drop a table from the Menu Items (right side).

In order to zoom in to view an individual table, select a table and select "View Table" (Build Menu on the top left).  You will now be able to rename, add, move, or delete "+ Pizza" and "+ Drink" items, using the same procedures.  (You cannot, however, edit the Pizza Image.)

When you have completed making changes, hit the Edit Mode button (top right) to turn off edit mode.

It may also be noted that it is possible to create various sections, each containing a group of tables, within a restaurant.  In order to accomplish this, create tables in the Restaurant View and rename them section 1, section 2, etc.  Then, drag and drop table within each of these sections.
